The DAX codes used in this project were used to create Power BI dashboards for a client on customer ATM terminal locations.
Situation: The customer was loosing revenue paying for ATM transactions conducted on other bank terminals by their own customers.
Task: To recommend best location for the client to locate their machines based on the highest withdrawal points of their clients in order to prevent revenue losses.
Action: Identified all terminals in a specifical location using geospatial analysis. Used Haversine calculation to calculate the nearest terminal to bank customer seeking to make withdrawal
Result: If implemented, customers will not spend on making withdrawal and the client will not loose revenue on paying other tiers for their customer's transactions.
